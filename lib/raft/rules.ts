/**
 * Ablation guards.
 *
 * Every non-obvious rule in Raft defends a specific safety property. Turning a rule
 * off and watching its property break is the fastest route to understanding why the
 * rule is there — and it is this project's reason to exist.
 *
 * Each guard lives here and is consulted at **exactly one** call site, named in the
 * descriptor below. That is what makes a toggle honest rather than cosmetic: there is
 * no second place where the rule is quietly still enforced, and no way for a toggle
 * to be a UI label with nothing behind it.
 *
 * A run with any flag off is *modified Raft* and is labelled as such, permanently and
 * visibly, everywhere it can be seen or shared.
